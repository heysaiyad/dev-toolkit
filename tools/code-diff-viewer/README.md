## Diff Algorithm Details

### Myers' Algorithm Implementation
The tool uses Myers' algorithm, the same algorithm used by Git and other version control systems:

- **Efficiency**: O(ND) time complexity where N is the sum of file lengths
- **Accuracy**: Finds the minimum number of edits required
- **Line-based**: Compares entire lines rather than characters
- **Context-aware**: Maintains proper line pairing for better visualization

### Diff Types
- **Equal**: Lines that are identical in both versions
- **Added**: Lines present only in the modified version
- **Deleted**: Lines present only in the original version
- **Modified**: Lines that have been changed between versions

## Visual Indicators

### Color Coding
- **Green Background**: Newly added lines
- **Red Background**: Deleted lines
- **Yellow Background**: Modified lines
- **Default Background**: Unchanged lines

### Statistics Bar
- **Additions Count**: Number of lines added
- **Deletions Count**: Number of lines removed
- **Changes Count**: Total number of changes

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Pure JavaScript**: No external diff libraries required
- **Class-based Design**: Clean, maintainable code structure
- **Event-driven**: Efficient handling of user interactions
- **Modular Functions**: Easy to extend and customize

### Key Components
- **Myers' Diff Algorithm**: Core comparison engine
- **File Reader API**: For handling file uploads
- **DOM Manipulation**: For rendering diff results
- **Event Handling**: For user interactions and shortcuts

### Performance Features
- **Debounced Updates**: Prevents excessive comparisons while typing
- **Efficient Rendering**: Only updates changed elements
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of resources
- **Large File Support**: Handles files up to several MB

## Browser Support

- **Chrome** (recommended)
- **Firefox**
- **Safari**
- **Edge**
- **Mobile browsers**

## Use Cases

### Development Workflow
- **Code Reviews**: Compare pull request changes
- **Version Comparison**: See what changed between commits
- **Refactoring**: Track code modifications during refactoring
- **Bug Investigation**: Identify what changed before a bug appeared

### Learning and Education
- **Code Evolution**: See how code develops over time
- **Best Practices**: Compare different implementations
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Understand different approaches to the same problem
- **Documentation**: Create visual comparisons for tutorials

### Collaboration
- **Team Reviews**: Share diffs with team members
- **Client Presentations**: Show changes to clients
- **Documentation**: Include diffs in technical documentation
- **Training**: Use for code review training sessions

## Privacy and Security

- **Local Processing**: All comparisons happen in your browser
- **No Data Upload**: Files never leave your device
- **No Server Communication**: No external API calls
- **Secure**: Your code remains completely private

## Performance Tips

### For Best Results
- Use files under 10MB for optimal performance
- Choose the correct programming language for syntax highlighting
- Use meaningful variable names and comments for better diff readability
- Break large files into smaller chunks for easier comparison

### Browser Optimization
- Use Chrome for the best performance
- Close other tabs to free up memory
- Enable hardware acceleration if available
- Use a modern browser for full feature support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Large files loading slowly**: Try breaking into smaller chunks
2. **No differences shown**: Ensure files are actually different
3. **Upload not working**: Check file format and size limits
4. **Performance issues**: Close other browser tabs

### Error Messages
- **"Error reading file"**: Check file format and permissions
- **"No differences found"**: Files are identical
- **"File too large"**: Try with a smaller file

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- **Word-level Diffs**: Character-by-character comparison
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced code highlighting
- **Export Options**: Save diffs as images or PDFs
- **Git Integration**: Compare with Git repositories
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Help resolve merge conflicts
- **History Tracking**: Save comparison history
- **Collaborative Features**: Share diffs with team members
