- **Class-based Design**: Clean, maintainable code structure
- **Event-driven**: Efficient handling of speech API events
- **Modular Functions**: Easy to extend and customize

### Key APIs Used
- **SpeechRecognition API**: For speech-to-text functionality
- **SpeechSynthesis API**: For text-to-speech functionality
- **Web Audio API**: For audio input/output handling
- **MediaDevices API**: For microphone access

### Error Handling
- **Permission Errors**: Microphone access denied
- **Network Errors**: Connection issues during recognition
- **Audio Errors**: Microphone not found or inaccessible
- **Browser Compatibility**: Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Voice Settings

### Speech Recognition Settings
- **Language**: Choose from 11+ supported languages
- **Continuous**: Keep listening until manually stopped
- **Interim Results**: Show partial results while speaking

### Speech Synthesis Settings
- **Voice**: Select from available system voices
- **Rate**: Speech speed (0.5x to 2.0x)
- **Pitch**: Voice pitch (0.0 to 2.0)
- **Volume**: Audio volume (0% to 100%)

## Privacy and Security

- **No Data Storage**: All processing happens locally in your browser
- **No Server Communication**: No data sent to external servers
- **Microphone Access**: Requires user permission for speech recognition
- **Local Processing**: Speech synthesis uses system voices only

## Performance Tips

### For Best Speech Recognition
- Use a good quality microphone
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Minimize background noise
- Use supported browsers (Chrome recommended)

### For Best Speech Synthesis
- Choose appropriate voice for your content
- Adjust rate for your listening preference
- Use shorter text segments for better control
- Test different voices to find your preferred one

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions and microphone access
2. **No speech recognition**: Ensure you're using a supported browser
3. **Poor recognition accuracy**: Check microphone quality and speaking clarity
4. **No voices available**: Refresh the page or restart your browser
5. **Speech synthesis not working**: Check if voices are loaded and browser support

### Error Messages
- **"Microphone permission denied"**: Allow microphone access in browser settings
- **"No speech detected"**: Speak louder or check microphone connection
- **"Network error"**: Check internet connection for speech recognition
- **"Voice not available"**: Wait for voices to load or refresh the page

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- **Voice Commands**: Control the interface with voice commands
- **Audio Recording**: Save speech as audio files
- **Text Export**: Export transcribed text to various formats
- **Voice Training**: Improve recognition accuracy over time
- **Custom Voices**: Upload and use custom voice models
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple text segments at once
