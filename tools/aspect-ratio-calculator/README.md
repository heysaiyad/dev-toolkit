## Technical Details

The diagonal calculation uses the Pythagorean theorem to compute the screen diagonal. All dimensions are converted to inches for diagonal calculation, then displayed in both inches and centimeters for convenience. The visual preview dynamically adjusts based on the selected aspect ratio and scales appropriately for the display size.
